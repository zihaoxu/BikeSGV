# BikeSGV Project
The mission of BikeSGV, or [Bike San Gabriel Valley](http://www.bikesgv.org/), is to create a more bicycle-, pedestrian-, and transit-friendly San Gabriel Valley. Last semester, Tech for Good partnered with BikeSGV to help them analyze bike count data they gathered over the past few years. Members of Tech for Good cleaned, wrangled and visualized the datasets and our results are featured in BikeSGV's [end-of-year report](http://www.bikesgv.org/sgvcounts.html).  

This semester, we will continue helping BikeSGV with several in-depth data analyses.
